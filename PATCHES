If you plan to submit patches, here's a checklist:

 Commits:

- make commits of logical units;
- do not modify piece of code not related to your commit;
- do not try to fix style of code you are not writing,
  it's just adding noise for no gain;
- check for unnecessary whitespace with "git diff --check" before commiting;
- do not check in commented out code or unneeded files;
- provide a meaningful commit message;
- the first line of the commit message should be a short;
  description and should skip the full stop;
- if you want your work included, add a
  "Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.com>" line to the
  commit message (or just use the option "-s" when commiting);
- make sure that you have tests for the bug you are fixing.
- if possible, add a unit test to the test suite under spec/.

 Patch:

- use "git format-patch -M" to create the patch;
- do not PGP sign your patch;
- be careful doing cut & paste into your mailer, not to corrupt whitespaces;
- if you change, add or remove the user API, the associated documentation
  should be updated as well;
- send the patch to the list (awesome-devel@naquadah.org) if (and only if)
  the patch is ready for inclusion. If you use git-send-email(1), please
  test it first by sending email to yourself.
