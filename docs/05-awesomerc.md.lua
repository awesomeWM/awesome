sections.DOC_ERROR_HANDLING = [[

Awesome is a window managing framework. It allows its users great (ultimate?)
flexibility. However, it also allows the user to write invalid code. Here's a
non-exhaustive list of possible errors:

 * Syntax: There is an `awesome -k` option available in the command line to
   check the configuration file. Awesome cannot start with an invalid `rc.lua`
 * Invalid APIs and type errors: Lua is a dynamic language. It doesn't have much
   support for static/compile time checks. There is the `luacheck` utility to
   help find some categories of errors. Those errors will cause Awesome to
   "drop" the current call stack and start over. Note that if it cannot
   reach the end of the `rc.lua` without errors, it will fall back to the
   original file.
 * Invalid logic: It is possible to write fully valid code that will render
   Awesome unusable (like an infinite loop or blocking commands). In that case,
   the best way to debug this is either using `print()` or using `gdb`. For
   this, see the [Debugging tips Readme section](../documentation/01-readme.md.html)
 * Deprecated APIs: The Awesome API is not frozen for eternity. After a decade
   of development and recent changes to enforce consistency, it hasn't
   changed much. This doesn't mean it won't change in the future. Whenever
   possible, changes won't cause errors but will instead print a deprecation
   message in the Awesome logs. These logs are placed in various places
   depending on the distribution. By default, Awesome will print errors on
  `stderr` and `stdout`.

sections.DOC_LOAD_THEME = [[
To create custom themes, the easiest way is to copy the `default` theme folder
from `/usr/share/awesome/themes/` into `~/.config/awesome` and modify it.

Awesome currently doesn't behave well without a theme containing all the "basic"
variables such as `bg_normal`. To get a list of all official variables, see
the [appearance guide](../documentation/06-appearance.md.html).

 <a id="global_keybindings" />
 This section stores the global keybindings. A global keybinding is a shortcut
 that will be executed when the key is pressed. It is different from
 <a href="#client_keybindings">client keybindings</a>. A client keybinding
 only works when a client is focused while a global one works all the time.

 Each keybinding is stored in an `awful.key` object. When creating such an
 object, you need to provide a list of modifiers, a key or keycode, a callback
 function and extra metadata used for the `awful.hotkeys_popup` widget.

 Common modifiers are:

 <table class='widget_list' border=1>
  <tr style='font-weight: bold;'>
   <th align='center'>Name</th>
   <th align='center'>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr><td>Mod4</td><td>Also called Super, Windows and Command âŒ˜</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Mod1</td><td>Usually called Alt on PCs and Option on Macs</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Shift</td><td>Both left and right shift keys</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Control</td><td>Also called CTRL on some keyboards</td></tr>
 </table>

 Note that both `Mod2` and `Lock` are ignored by default. If you wish to
 use them, add `awful.key.ignore_modifiers = {}` to your `rc.lua`. `Mod3`,
 `Mod5` are usually not bound in most keyboard layouts. There is an X11 utility
 called `xmodmap` to bind them. See
 [the ARCH Linux Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/xmodmap) for more
 information.

 The key or keycode is usually the same as the keyboard key, for example:

 * "a"
 * "Return"
 * "Shift_R"

 Each key also has a code. This code depends on the exact keyboard layout. It
 can be obtained by reading the terminal output of the `xev` command. A keycode
 based keybinding will look like `#123` where 123 is the keycode.

 The callback has to be a function. Note that a function isn't the same as a
 function call. If you use, for example, `awful.tag.viewtoggle()` as the
 callback, you store the **result** of the function. If you wish to use that
 function as a callback, just use `awful.tag.viewtoggle`. The same applies to
 methods. If you have to add parameters to the callback, wrap them in another
 function. For the toggle example, this would be
 `function() awful.tag.viewtoggle(mouse.screen.tags[1]) end`.

 Note that global keybinding callbacks have no argument. If you wish to act on
 the current `client`, use the <a href="#client_keybindings">client keybindings</a>
 table.
]]


sections.DOC_CLIENT_KEYBINDINGS = [[
 <a id="client_keybindings" />

 A client keybinding is a shortcut that will get the currently focused client
 as its first callback argument. For example, to toggle a property, the callback
 will look like `function(c) c.sticky = not c.sticky end`. For more information
 about the keybinding syntax, see the
 <a href="#global_keybindings">global keybindings</a> section.
