sections.DOC_ERROR_HANDLING = [[
Awesome is a window managing framework. It allows its users great (ultimate?)
flexibility. However, it also allows the user to write invalid code. There is
multiple "levels" of problems:

 * Syntax: There is an `awesome -k` option available in the command line to
   check this. Awesome cannot start with an invalid `rc.lua`
 * Invalid APIs and type errors: Lua is a dynamic language. It doesn't have much
   support for static/compile time checks. There is the `luacheck` utility to
   help find some categories of errors. Those errors will cause Awesome to
   "drop" the current call stack and start over. Note that if the config cannot
   reach the end of the `rc.lua` without errors, it will fallback to the
   original file.
 * Invalid logic: It is possible to write fully valid code that will leave
   Awesome unusable (like an infinite loop or blocking commands). In that case,
   the best way to debug this is either using `print()` or using `gdb`. For
   this, see the [Debugging tips Readme section](../documentation/01-readme.md.html)
 * Deprecated APIs: Awesome API is not frozen for eternity. While after a
   decade and recent changes to enforce consistency, it doesn't change as much,
   it will likely be changed in the future. When possible, changes wont cause
   errors but will instead print a deprecation message in Awesome logs. Those
   logs are placed in various places depending on the distribution. By default,
   Awesome will print this on stderr and stdout.

sections.DOC_LOAD_THEME = [[
To create custom themes, the easiest way is to copy the `default` theme folder
from `/usr/share/awesome/themes/` into `~/.config/awesome` and modify it.

Awesome currently doesn't behave well without a theme containing all the "basic"
variables such as `bg_normal`. To get a list of all official variables, see
the [appearance guide](../documentation/06-appearance.md.html).
